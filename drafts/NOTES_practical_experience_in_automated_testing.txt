Practical Experience in Automated Testing

	Testing tools, as sophisticated as they have become, are still
	dependent upon consistency in the test environment. This should be
	quite obvious, but having a dedicated test environment is absolutely
	necessary. If testers don't have control of their test environment and
	test data, the required setup for tests may not meet the requirements
	of those tests. When manual testing is done testers may sometimes
	'work around' test setup issues. Automated test scripts are less
	flexible and require specific setup scenarios, thereby needing more
	control.

Testowanie automatyczne najlepiej przeprowadzać w dedykowanym środowisku.

	Experience has shown that most bugs are not found by running automated
	tests.  Most bugs are found in the process of creating the scripts, or
	the first time the code is tested

	That test automation mostly buys you is the opportunity to not spend
	valuable man-hours re-testing code that has been tested before, but
	which has to be tested in any case because the risk is too high not to
	test it.

przeznaczyć na manualne testowanie nowych funkcji.
