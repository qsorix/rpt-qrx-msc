What's the best way to choose a test automation tool?

This means there must be a mechanism by which the computer can do an automatic
comparison between actual and expected results for every automated test
scenario and unambiguously make a pass or fail determination. This factor may
require a significant change in the entire approach to testing, since in
manual testing a human is involved and can:

    * make mental adjustments to expected test results based on variations in
      the pre-test state of the software system
    * often make on-the-fly adjustments, if needed, to data used in the test
    * make pass/fail judgements about results of each test
    * make quick judgements and adjustments for changes to requirements.
    * make a wide variety of other types of judgements and adjustments as needed.


Automated testing rarely enables savings in the cost of testing, although it
may result in software lifecycle savings (or increased sales) just as with any
other quality-related initiative.
